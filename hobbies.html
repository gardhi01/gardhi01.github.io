<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<p>In my spare time, I enjoy reading, playing video games, and watching anime.  I'm more of an indoor person, but I do like to swim.  I also love music.  I arrange video game music for piano for fun.</p>
<p>I love playing the piano.  I took lessons between second grade and my senior year of high school.  Now I play piano to calm down.<img src="http://thewarehouserpc.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Piano-Keyboard.jpg" height=500px width=500px></p>
